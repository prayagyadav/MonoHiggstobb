Note: Follow these steps exactly:
step 1 : To be safe remove any older installations by 'rm -rf shell .bashrc .env'
step 2 : 'bash bootstrap'
step 3 : './shell coffeateam/coffea-dask:latest-py3.8' (3.8 works in the wisconsin machines)
step 4 : 'exit'
step 5 : './shell'
Enjoy!


Note: Use the older python3.8 image only while bootstrapping. After that, use the coffea-dask-cc7:latest image by simply calling ./shell
